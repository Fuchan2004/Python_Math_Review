## Goals
* Introduction to python and programming languages in general terms
* Introduction to the python interpreter
* Introduction to conda
* Setting up jupter notebook on the HPC
* Survey of terms and data types in python
* Operators in python
* Lists, dictionaries, sets
* Libraries and modules
* For loops!

## Why Python?
Python is an open source, object-oriented programming language with useful applications in data science, numerical modeling, GIS, and developing open source software. Other than Python there are a variety of programming languages that can be used. For science you can use whatever suits your work. Popular choices include:
* Python
* Pearl
* R
* Matlab
* C/C++

Once you master one programming language, it is much easier to learn the next. Python is particularly beginner friendly due to the simple syntax while allowing you to go through complex tasks, and is thus a popular first programming language. 

Python is:
* Interactive
* Interpreted
* Portable
* Modular
* Object-oriented
* Open access
* Free
* Widely used


Python has:
* An extensive (scientific) user base
* A large and varied set of support libraries
* Good system of scalable tools (e.g. Pangeo)
* Good scientific notebook style interactive interface (Jupyter)

## Running the Python interpreter 

## Jupyter Notebooks
Jupyter (a mash up of Julia-Python-R) is a pen-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. The power of Jupyter is that it can be set up to run any number of code interpreters. This can be done by selecting a different "kernel". These notebooks can be shared, downloaded, posted to websites, turned into pdfs... the options are basically endless. They can even be viewed on Github! `jupyter notebooks` are interactive and easily readable interphases for running and visualizing code and keeping notes such as Python and R. Notably, code and output graphics or answers are tightly linked together rather like a laboratory notebook. Jupyter notebooks act as a GUI interface of sorts to run python code. Yet, they are saved as convenient chunks of code (ending in .ipynb) that can be opened again, re-run, shared, and modified.

### Anaconda
Anaconda is used to run and manage `jupyter notebooks`. It is a free and open-source distribution of the Python and R programming languages for scientific computing. Through the function `conda` Anaconda facilitates the installation of python and R programming languages as well as packages. It is a great tool for ensuring that computational environment is associated with code and really streamlines program installation and use. 
* Package and libraries manager for many languages (Python, R, Java, C/C++, etc.)
* Download includes most recent version of Python & relevant libraries (numpy, pandas, etc.)
* Navigator application
* Connections with associated software (Jupyter, Spyder, RStudio, etc.)

### Opening Jupyter Notebooks
To run jupyter notebooks on a local computer type `jupyter notebook` in your terminal. It will automatically open the browser to run jupyter notebooks.
Prior to this class we asked you to download the 2024_Python_Math_Review folder on your computer. By going to terminal and opening jupyter notebook from this folder, you will reach following page displaying the contents of the folder within jupyter.

The screen you see is called the home screen or dash board. This should show you a navigable file structure much like what you might find on your computer. In our folder we can find files ending on `.ipynb` which are our jupyter notebooks containing the code we will work with today. For detailed information on how to design and organize your jupyter notebook, check out following resource on shortcuts for markdowns: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet

**Now lets get started with the actual coding!**
