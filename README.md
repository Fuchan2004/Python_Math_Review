## Why Python?
In science there are a variety of programming languages that can be used. For science you can use whatever suits your work. Popular choices include:
* Python
* Pearl
* R
* Matlab
* C/C++

Once you master one programming language, it is much easier to learn the next. Python is particularly beginner friendly due to the simple syntax while allowing you to go through complex tasks, and is thus a popular first programming language. 

Python is:
* Interactive
* Interpreted
* Portable
* Modular
* Object-oriented
* Open access
* Free
* Widely used


Python has:
* An extensive (scientific) user base
* A large and varied set of support libraries
* Good system of scalable tools (e.g. Pangeo)
* Good scientific notebook style interactive interface (Jupyter)
