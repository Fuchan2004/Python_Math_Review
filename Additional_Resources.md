## Resources:

### Conda and shell:
- [Conda Guide](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/_downloads/843d9e0198f2a193a3484886fa28163c/conda-cheatsheet.pdf)
- [Conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org)
- [Working in shell](https://github.com/csdms/ivy/blob/main/lessons/shell/index.md)

### Editors/coding platforms:
- [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) (What we used in this session)
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) (Can run interactive code in addition to writing traditional scripts)

### Plotting:
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/)
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org) (Very useful for plotting Pandas dataframes!)

### Best practices:
- [Python style guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)
- Remember to comment your code: *"Code is read more often than it is written. Code should always be written in a way that promotes readability."* -Guido Van Rossum, creator of Python
- Use clear, descriptive names for variables -- it's generally better to be clear than short
- Build environments rather than adding packages to base environment in order to prevent conflicts and make easier to share code
- A few good articles on best practices ([1](https://python.land/12-habits-of-highly-effective-python-developers), [2](https://medium.com/@utkarshshukla.author/best-python-coding-practices-writing-clean-and-efficient-code-4784946a17d0))

### Other Useful Python Resources:

[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/): likely has an answer to almost any programming question you can think of

[Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/): information on installation and uses of Anaconda, a helpful integrated Python tool

[GitHub](https://github.com/): data/code repository - use it as a way to keep records of changes to your codes (i.e. version control) and a way for collaborators to work on the same scripts & projects
    
- Very useful [GitHub workflow lesson](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)!

[OceanPython](https://oceanpython.org/): Python for Oceanographers & Marine Scientists! Cool (& probably relevant) oceanographic coding examples in Python.

Or ChatGPT! But donÂ´t trust everything ChatGPT says ;)
